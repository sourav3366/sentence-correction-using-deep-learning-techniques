# sentence-correction-using-deep-learning-techniques
I  have tried 4 techniques to solve this problem statement

a. Basic encoder-decoder model characterwise with nlp augmentation

b. Encoder decoder model along with attention layer using **general** scoring function and done nlp augmentation also

c. Encoder decoder model along with attention layer using **concat** scoring function and done nlp augmentation also

d. Encoder decoder model along with attention layer using **dot** scoring function and done nlp augmentation also
